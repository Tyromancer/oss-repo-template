### Why is it important to choose a License?

A license for open-source software protects the freedom to:

- run the program
- study the program
- redistribute the program
- modify the program

The authors of the program may also pose restrictions and responsibilities through licensing.

### Why shouldn't use a project that does not have an explicit license?

This is because if the author of the project license it afterwards, users of the project may violate the newly posed restrictions.

### Failure to follow the open systems model?

I do agree with the statement. As an open-source project, it is important to absorb suggestions and ideas from the community by letting the community to discuss and decide the future of the project. The clients know what they want, but the developers do not necessarily. Also, the passage mentioned that the Gopher team did not have a standard approach for development, which led to numerous forks not contributing back.

### Justification of Linux with GPL v2 license

Linus Torvalds started developing the Linux project since he was not satisfied by the education-use-only license of MINIX. He switched to the GPL license since after that the project could use any code licensed under the GNU GPL license, for example, from the GNU Project.

The GPL v2 license also allows for commercial use and redistribution, and modification. In this way, the community is able to create various distributions based on the needs. Allowing for modification also lets the community able to work to port the project onto other platforms.

The GPL v2 license prohibits sublicensing and clients must disclose source code and state changes. In this way, the project protects the "freedom" of the users of Linux.
